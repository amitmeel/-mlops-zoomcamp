**What is MlOps:**
----------------
MLOps stands for Machine Learning Operations. MLOps is a core function of Machine Learning engineering, focused on streamlining the process of taking machine learning models to production, and then maintaining and monitoring them.

There are various steps before we can deploy a model to production. for example, we need to:
1. data collection from various sources
2. data labelling
3. data validation (whether the data is valid for the rest of the process)
4. data preprocessing (EDA, data transformation and prepration)
5. model training
6. model evaluation
7. model deployment
8. model monitoring
9. model retraining based on feedback from users

So basically, MLOps is a set of practices for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to simplify and automate the above mentioend steps and run AI projects successfully.
